            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Michael Squires, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Illinois - Chicago, passionate about software engineering and always ready to tackle challenging projects with innovative solutions. My university years provided a deep dive into the world of coding, igniting my passion for software development, and ever since, I've been honing my skills in various programming languages and technologies. Aside from my technical abilities, I pride myself on my quick adaptability, strong analytical skills, and attention to detail, ensuring I deliver high-quality, efficient software solutions. When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying active with workouts, keeping up with sports, engaging in creative projects, and immersing myself in the gaming world - a hobby that also inspires my professional work due to the complexity and creativity behind game designs. As I embark on my professional journey, I'm eager to collaborate with other tech enthusiasts, contribute my skills to the industry, and welcome any exciting opportunities that come my way. Feel free to explore my portfolio to understand more about my work, and don't hesitate to reach out for potential projects or collaborations.</p>
